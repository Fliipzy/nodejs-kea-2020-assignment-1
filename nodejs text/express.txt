:: Express ::

Express is a node.js web framework that provides lots of features for web applications.
Creating RESTful API's with Express is very quick and easy.

__Routing endpoints__

Endpoints are our application's (URIs) E.g /api/students, /about, /contact. When we route
endpoints we essential decides how our web server responds to the clients requests.
For example, if a client sends this HTTP request:

    GET /docs/express HTTP/1.1

We want to provide/send back the content associated with that endpoint - an html file in this
instance. 

__Serving static content__

Once the client receives our html file and renders it in their browser, there could be images,
css, js and other files referenced inside that html file. This content is usually called
static content, because it doesn't have to be generated, modified or processed.

An example of a static ressource that a user needs in order to display the view as intended could 
be a css file:

    <link href="../static/css/style.css">

By default for safety measures, Express doesn't allow clients to request and receive any and all files
from our system. That's why we need to tell the Express app where our static content folder
is located, that way we can store all the necessary files there for serving.

It's really simple to set up with Express. First create a folder in your project for static files:

    ├─ app.js
    ├─ html
    │    └─ index.html
    └─ static
         ├─ css
         │   └─ style.css
         ├─ js
         └─ images

Now inside your app.js file, write the following:

    app.use(express.static('static'))

The string parameter is the relative path to the static directory from the app.js file.
You can now serve the style.css file to clients.

    http://localhost:8080/css/style.css
