:: jQuery ::

jQuery is a large JavaScript library that contains
code for HTML & CSS manipulation, AJAX, effects,
animations and more. 

jQuery sets out to simplyfy complicated concepts from 
JavaScript and makes developers able to do a lot of 
stuff by writing fewer lines of code.

You don't necessarily need jQuery to do web development,
but it's by far one of the most popular JS libraries out
there for that sole purpose.


__ How to use jQuery? __

We have two ways of implementing jQuery into our projects:

Download the library from <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery.com</a>.
Now put the file inside your project and link it in your html files by
using the script tag:
	
	<body>
		...
		
		<script src="./scripts/jquery-3.4.1.js"></script>
	</body>

The second way is to provide a link from a content delivery network (CDN).
You can copy jQuery CDN links from here <a href="https://code.jquery.com">code.jquery.com</a>.
Now place it in a script tag at the bottom of the HTML body.

	<body>
		...

		<script src="code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js"></script>
	</body>
