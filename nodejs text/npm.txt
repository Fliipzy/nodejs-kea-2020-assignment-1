:: NPM ::

Node package manager (NPM) is a tool for downloading and installing other tools or modules for node.js
NPM consist of 3 main parts: The website, the command line client and the registry.

The website is where you can browse and discover new packages. You can also set up your own
organization and manage your own packages.

The command line client is a program that comes with node.js, when you install it on your system.
It's through this program you download and install packages that exists in the npm registry.

The registry is a large database comprised of the JavaScript code, available to download from the npm client.

__Installing packages with NPM__

Whenever you use Node.js, you should include a package.json file in your project. This file is where
you specify metadata that informs NPM about your project and it's dependencies.

Heres a bare minimum package.json file with metadata about our node.js project:

    {
        "name": "myProject", 
        "version": "0.1", 
        "description": "This is my first node.js project"
        "main": "app.js" //Your main js file
        "author": "Fred", // Your name
        "license": "ISC" //License of your choosing
    }

If you don't want to create and fill out the file yourself you can use npm for that too, just type:

    npm init

This command generates a package.json file in your project and you will be prompted to enter the
metadata information as seen above.

Now in order to define the modules we need, we add a collection to the file called "dependencies".
Inside the collection we append packages, like so: 

    {
        "name": "myProject", 
        "version": "0.1",
        "description": "This is my first node.js project"
        "main": "app.js"

        "dependencies": {
            "express": "^4.17.1"
        }
    }

As you can see we specified the package name as the key and the version as value. 
In this example we install the popular Express web framework. More information
about Express can be found <a href="/docs/express">here</a>.

Now, all there's left to do is run one more command from NPM:

    npm install

NPM will now look for the package.json file and download all the specified modules, to the project.
