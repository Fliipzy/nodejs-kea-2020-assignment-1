:: Nodemon ::

Nodemon is a program that helps node developers speed up their development process, by
automatically restarting the application when a file changes in the project.

It's very easy to use since it doesn't require any additional code or configuration in your project.

__How to install it?__
You can use NPM to download and install the program:

    npm install -g nodemon

The -g flag indicates that you want to install nodemon globally on your system, it also
puts the nodemon executable on your system path.

If you install nodemon locally the variable path will not be set. Instead you could use
the node package executor (NPX) tool for that.

__How to use it?__

It's very simple to start your node application with nodemon, just type:

    nodemon <node app file>

Once you need to close the running server simply type Ctrl + C into your terminal.
